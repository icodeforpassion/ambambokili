    "description_long": "Dolphin Birthday Song splashes into an underwater wonderland where mer-kids organize a surprise party for their dolphin buddy. Coral reefs shimmer like disco lights while Malayalam rap verses introduce ocean conservation facts. Each guest ‚Äì a turtle DJ, a jellyfish percussionist, and a sardine choir ‚Äì teaches hand movements resembling waves, bubbles, and coral sways. The storyline highlights teamwork as the crew bakes a seaweed cake, crafts biodegradable decorations, and practices mindful breathing before the surprise reveal. Interactive prompts encourage viewers to clap along, mimic aquatic movements, and shout birthday wishes in Malayalam. The bridge segment delivers easy science trivia about dolphin clicks and mangrove nurseries, making the party both educational and entertaining. The celebration wraps with a choreographed finale that invites kids to perform a water-inspired dance at their next birthday party, reinforcing messages of friendship and ocean stewardship.",
